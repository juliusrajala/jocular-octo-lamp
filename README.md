# Twitter-data reading interface
This is a small pet project I started to work on due to my recent interest in data-handling.

The idea is to build a simple command-prompt interface for handling, storing and manipulating tweets and underlying data.

## Installation
To install and use the interface, you'll need to install Tweepy, an open source easy to use Python library that connects to the twitter api.
You'll find tweepy and it's documentation here: https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy

Easiest way to install Tweepy is via pip
```
pip install tweepy
```

After tweepy's installed and you've cloned this repo, create a lib folder in TweetMiner/ and create a python file here with your twitter access tokens called secrets. This file should be personal to your account.

Then you're ready to use and edit these files to your own liking.

I'm releasing this under the WTFPL -license.
